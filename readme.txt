Command Line Interface
----------------------

muCommander comes with a few command line switches.
The following options are available:
 -a FILE, --assoc FILE             Load associations from FILE.
 -b FILE, --bookmarks FILE         Load bookmarks from FILE.
 -c FILE, --configuration FILE     Load configuration from FILE
 -C FILE, --commandbar FILE        Load command bar from FILE
 -e FOLDER, --extensions FOLDER    Load extensions from FOLDER.
 -f FILE, --commands FILE          Load custom commands from FILE.
 -i, --ignore-warnings             Do not fail on warnings (default).
 -k FILE, --keymap FILE            Load keymap from FILE
 -n, --no-debug                    Disable debug output to stdout
 -d, --debug                       Enable debug output to stdout (default)
 -p FOLDER, --preferences FOLDER   Store configuration files in FOLDER
 --no-splash                       Disable splashscreen on startup
 --splash                          Enable splashscreen on startup (default)
 -S, --silent                      Do not print verbose error messages
 -s FILE, --shell-history FILE     Load shell history from FILE
 -t FILE, --toolbar FILE           Load toolbar from FILE
 -u FILE, --credentials FILE       Load credentials from FILE
 -h, --help                        Print the help text and exit
 -v, --version                     Print the version and exit
 -V, --verbose                     Print verbose error messages (default)
 -w, --fail-on-warnings            Quits when a warning is encountered during
                                   the boot process.

In addition to these, muCommander will interpret anything that comes after the
last switch as a URI and load it in its windows.
So for example:

 mucommander -b ~/.bookmarks.xml ftp://user@myftp.com ~/dev http://slashdot.org

Will:
 - read bookmarks from ~/bookmarks.xml
 - load a connection to myftp.com in the left panel of the main window
 - load ~/dev in the right panel of the main window
 - open a second window and load http://slashdot.org in its left panel
 - load the default directory in the second window's fourth panel


Advanced configuration
----------------------

muCommander has some advanced configuration options which cannot (yet) be
accessed through the GUI.
After having booted the application for the first time, the following files will
be created in muCommander's preferences folder:
 - action_keymap.xml (keyboard shortcuts description file).
 - command_bar.xml   (commandbar description file).
 - toolbar.xml       (toolbar description file).

Brave users can edit these XML files and tune muCommander to their own needs.
Here are a few hints on how to edit these files.


 - action_keymap.xml
All customisable actions are listed in that file, using the following format:
<action class="com.mucommander.ui.action.CopyFilesToClipboardAction"
        keystroke="control C" alt_keystroke="meta C"/>

It's probably safer not to mess around with the class argument, as this could
actually remove features from muCommander.
keystroke and alt_keystroke should be fairly safe explanatory. It's important to
note, however, that due to Java's capricious nature, the case is important.
CONTROL C will not be understood, and neither will control c.


 - command_bar.xml
This file describes the content of your command bar (the bit will all the
buttons on the lower part of the window).
Each item in the file corresponds to a button in the bar. You can edit them, add
some or remove some.

The syntax is as follows:
<button action="com.mucommander.ui.action.CopyAction"
        alt_action="com.mucommander.ui.action.LocalCopyAction"/>
Where:
 - action is the main action executed by the button
 - alt_action is the action executed by the button when the shift key is held
   down

For a list of legal actions, please refer to action_keymap.xml


 - toolbar.xml
This file controls the content of your toolbar. It works in the same way as
command_bar.xml, with two notable differences:
  - you can use a <separator/> element to add a separator in the toolbar
  - alt_action is not available


- commands.xml
This file controls the various system commands that muCommander can call.
Documentation on how to customise those commands can be found here:
http://www.mucommander.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=420


- associations.xml
This file controls custom command / file associations.
Documentation on how to customise those associations can be found here:
http://www.mucommander.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=634
